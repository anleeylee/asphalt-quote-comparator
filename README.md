# Asphalt Quote Comparator

Normalize contractor bids and explain objective scope and cost differences — without ranking.

## What it does

Parses one or more quote texts/PDFs/spreadsheets into a comparable dataset: area, tons, thickness, scope line items, unit prices, lump sums and grand total, with material / delivery / labor / equipment / removal kept separate and original wording preserved. Deterministic derived metrics ($/SF, $/ton, implied thickness) are computed from stated quantities only. Flags call out plan-quantity mismatch, spec-thickness mismatch, missing scope, missing tonnage and missing totals. It never picks a 'best' contractor.

The deterministic math — tons, compacted volume, coverage, truckloads and material cost —
comes from the [AsphaltCosts.com](https://asphaltcosts.com/) web calculation engine. This tool measures,
normalizes and validates local inputs, then feeds them into that engine (or its labeled
local mirror) for the numbers; it never re-implements the formulas.

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m scripts.s05_quote_comparator --project ./project --input ./fixtures/quotes
```

Run with `--help` for all options. Every script in this family shares the same CLI
convention: `--project <path> --input <path> --output <path> --format json|csv|md|xlsx|pdf
--config <path> --verbose --dry-run`.

## Outputs

- `quote_comparison.json` — normalized quotes + derived metrics + flags
- `quote_comparison.xlsx` — side-by-side comparison sheet
- `quote_flags.md` — critical flags in human-readable form

## Quality gates

- deterministic schema validation on every record;
- golden sample fixtures with exact expected values (`tests/`);
- review queue: low-confidence values, ambiguous scales and conflicts land in
  `review_queue.json` / summary — never a silent fix;
- audit log: every run writes `run_id`, timings, input hashes, engine version
  and outputs to `<project>/audit/`.

## Testing

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

## Security & privacy

Local files stay local by default. API keys live in environment variables
(`ASPHALTCOSTS_API_KEY`, `ADI_AI_API_KEY`) — never in source code. Derived files are
written to `working/` or `output/`; source files are never modified.

## The calculation engine

[**AsphaltCosts.com**](https://asphaltcosts.com/) is the deterministic calculation layer: area → compacted volume → net tons → order tons (allowance applied once) → truckloads → material cost, with sourced planning defaults (145 lb/ft³ FHWA density, editable allowance and truck capacity). This tool feeds measured and validated inputs into that engine (or its labeled local mirror, `asphaltcosts-web-engine/1.0-mirror`) and never re-implements the formulas.
